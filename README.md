# Bridge-Builder-Game-Project
BridgeBuilder is a strategic command-line game merging engineering prowess and strategy. Assume the role of a skilled civil engineer constructing a vital bridge across a large lake, navigating obstacles like a swamp in the bottom corner, while contending against an adversary's automated engineer placing hindrances in your path.

#Project Details
Objective: Create a command-line game using Java where players construct bridges across a grid-based lake, competing against an automated rival engineer.
Tools Used: Java programming language, Eclipse IDE
Game Description
Bridge Builder is a challenging game where players take on the role of a brilliant civil engineer tasked with constructing a crucial bridge across a vast lake, overcoming obstacles set by a rival engineer.

#Gameplay Highlights
Grid-based Construction: Set on a grid representing the lake, players aim to build a continuous bridge from left to right or bottom to top, with diagonal bridges also an option.
Challenge Modes: The game offers easy and hard modes, influencing the strategy of the rival engineer.
Scoring Mechanism: Points are awarded based on the direction and complexity of the bridge, with bonuses for larger grid sizes.
Features

Classes to Implement: The project involves implementing three core Java classes: GameBoard, Engineer, and Player.
Testing: Test cases provided to ensure proper functionality and scoring.
